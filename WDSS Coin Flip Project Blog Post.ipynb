    "## 1.1 Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Random events happen without an underlying pattern, meaning no consistent algorithm can produce a series of truly random events. \n",
    "After numerous psychological tests, scientists found that people often approach the concept of randomness with underlying assumptions about its nature, usually ones that contradict its definition. \n",
    "Humans have an inherent tendency to look for predictability in anything they encounter to improve their understanding of it.\n",
    "Unfortunately, this instinct often leads to a paradox where one attempts to make sense of randomness as something predictable, worsening their understanding of it instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the development of statistical mathematics, humans can now “measure” the randomness of events with appropriate hypothesis testing methods.\n",
    "The motivation behind this project is to create a program that, with the help of hypothesis testing theory, grades a user’s ability to create plausible random sequences.\n",
    "This project is interested only in measuring randomness in human-generated binary sequences."

    "## 2.2 Hypothesis Test Review\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis is a statement with an unspecified truth value that depends on what people argue it to be.\n",
    "People can't fully validate a hypothesis about the properties of a variate (e.g. the mean, the variance) without analysing all members of the population related to the variate, which is often impossible.\n",
    "Therefore, statisticians use samples, a limited number of members from the population, to yield partial evidence for the properties of a variate.\n",
    "A hypothesis test is a tool for producing partial evidence for a hypothesis from samples, the performance of which depends on the amount of information available for testing and the nature of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test often conveniently gives evidence as a p-value, a value that supports the hypothesis the closer it is to one and opposes it, the closer it is to zero.\n",
    "A p-value is commonly defined as the probability that a variate abiding by its hypothesised properties produced a given sample.\n",
    "The smaller the probability that the hypothesised variate could have produced the sample, the smaller the p-value.\n",
    "By this logic, a p-value of a test can serve as a measure of how closely a series of Bernoulli events can resemble a given binary sequence."

    "## 2.3 Bernoulli Distribution Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Bernoulli distribution test tests the plausibility that a series of identical, independent Bernoulli events can produce a given binary sequence.\n",
    "A Bernoulli event is essentially a coin toss with a set bias towards a specified side of the coin.\n",
    "Based on this interpretation of a Bernoulli event, the Bernoulli distribution test is highly appropriate for the project’s purpose.\n",
    "The test uses the proportion of 1s to the sequence length as its only input, which carries no information about the arrangement of the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, a sample with a 1s to length ratio that strongly deviates from the hypothesised proportion would result in a small p-value upon applying the Bernoulli distribution test.\n",

    "## 2.4 Generalised Runs Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalised runs test is a hypothesis test inspired by the non-parametric Wald-Wolfowitz runs test.\n",
    "The Wald-Wolfowitz runs test tests the serial independence of entries in a binary sequence of a given length, using the number of runs in the series as an input.\n",
    "Unlike the Wald-Wolfowitz test, the generalised runs test does not assume that samples come from a finite population and does not assume that the two outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, unlike the Bernoulli distribution test, the generalised runs test has an underdeveloped theory.\n",
    "Statisticians do not yet know the limiting distribution of runs in a Bernoulli trial sequence.\n",
    "Regardless, the test considers the arrangement of **1**s and **0**s in the sequence, which the Bernoulli distribution test does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence with one run is a repetition of one symbol. In contrast, a sequence with maximal runs is a periodic sequence of isolated **1**s and **0**s.\n",
    "The two possibilities mentioned strongly express patterned behaviour, meaning they are weak contenders for being random sequences.\n",
    "Therefore, the number of runs on a sequence would be between one and the sequence length to plausibly represent a series of independent Bernoulli events."

    "This test also considers the arrangement of **1**s and **0**s in the sequence, though differently this time.\n",

    "A sequence whose maximum run length is one is a periodic sequence of isolated **1**s and **0**s.\n",
    "Alternatively, a sequence with a maximum run as long as the series consists of only one symbol.\n",

    "## 2.6 Hadamard-Walsh Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how one can decompose functions, with continuous domains, into a sum of sine and cosine waves with a Fourier transform, one can decompose binary sequences into sums of Walsh functions with a Hadamard-Walsh transform.\n",
    "A Walsh function is a periodic square wave function that takes one and negative one as its values.\n",
    "One can decompose any binary sequence into Walsh functions because they constitute a complete set of orthogonal discrete functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transform yields a vector that numerically indicates how strongly a given binary sequence resembles each Walsh function.\n",
    "The disadvantage of the Hadamard-Walsh transform is it works only with vectors with lengths equal to powers of two, so the project will work only with binary sequences of lengths 32 and 64 to account for the limitation.\n",
    "Theoretically, a random sequence is more likely to resemble every Walsh function weakly.\n",

    "\n",
    "The final project app functions perfectly; however, it takes significantly longer to calculate p-values for samples of length 64 than 32.\n",
    "The excess processing stems from the calculation of the CDFs of both the max run test and the general runs test, requiring a large number of computations to complete.\n",
    "One can reduce the program computation time by deriving the limiting distributions of the discrete CDFs, allowing for significantly faster calculations that way.\n",
    "It would be ideal also to add time series methods to test the independence between sample entries, though time restrictions prevented the realisation of such implementation.\n",
