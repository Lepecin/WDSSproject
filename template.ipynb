    "## Markdown - what and how ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Using Markdown is different than using an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., `# Heading One`). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks `**` before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). \n",

    "This [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) should geet you started with the basic syntax of Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to add code to the notebook ?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a piece of code to be included included in your notebook, then you should add it in a seprate `Code` cell. This `Code` cell can be displayed or hidden in the final rendering of the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook the inclusion / exclusion of a code cell in the final output is controlled with the Cell Tags. \n",
    "To hide a `Code` cell from the output mark it with a `remove_input` tag. \n",
    "To hide the output of a `Code` cell from the final blog mark it with a `remove_all_output` tag."
